## Name Project: <b>Build Reactjs from scratch (using webpack 5+) not CRA<b>

**Includes:**

- Setup babel to transpile newer ECMAScript code for older browsers
- Support CSS/SCSS
- Have separate configurations for local development and production build  
  (for example, generate sourcermap files in local, but not generate them in production)
- Use CSS Modules (with SCSS) but still can import SCSS globally
- Add autoPrefixer to cover browser discrepancies on CSS implementation
